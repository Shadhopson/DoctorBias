["I actually made an appointment looking at the reviews & I'm totally satisfied & happy . Even though the office was small but it was clean & the receptionist was really friendly & helpful! There wasn't  long wait time like other clinics! The doctor was really nice & knowledgeable!! I'm happy to choose her as my PCP!",
 'My family and I are very pleased to have Dr. Aung as our Primary Care Physician. Dr. Aung was kind, generous with her time by listening throughly and offers step-by-step guide on all procedures done and what needed to be done. Dr. Aung and her staff members are Exceptional!!! Thx you very much for making our visit comfortable. ',
 'Dr. Aung and her staff have been very kind and helpful. Dr. Aung was professional, patient, and understanding. Thx you!',
 'Dr. Aung is thorough, concise, and friendly. Her and her office team took very good care of me to ensure I had the care I needed. Happy to have found her office on ZocDoc',
 "She's simply the best! I am glad I have found her for my primary doctor. Deff recommend her",
 "Dr. Aung was very thorough and helpful. She asked me many questions to get my medical history and more details about my condition so that she could know what to focus on during the physical exam. After, she explained her medical advice so that I could understand how I could contribute to bettering my health. I'm happy to have her as my PCP. ",

 "I stopped seeing my regular doctor because there were insane wait times and the office was overbooked. I've seen other doctors since and had very bad experiences, especially if I could get an appointment right away. Dr Aung had many time slots opened which made me wary. However, from the moment I booked the appointment, it has been a great experience! Within an hour, I got a call from the office confirming my insurance and letting me know if there was anything I needed to bring/do before my visit. At the office, I was seen right away. Both Dr. Aung and the nurses were very calm, knowledgeable, and explained to me exactly what was being done to me. I was even given a snack right after my blood test since I hadn't eaten all day. It is obvious that everyone working there actually care about their patients and I'm surprised there isn't a line waiting out the door! One thing I noticed was that no notes were written down as I talked, which makes for a more personal experience but also makes me wonder if she will actually remember everything I said. Either way I'm glad I found such a great doctor with such a short wait time. I think I have a new primary doctor!",
 "I avoided getting my annual for years because my primary doctor had ridiculous wait times and often overbooked. When I tried to find a new doctor, they often didn't seem to care. Dr aung has many time slots opened on zocdoc, even on the weekends, making me wary. However, from the moment I booked my appointment, the experience has been great. The receptionist called me within an hour to verify my insurance and make sure I brought everything I needed. At the office, I was seen right away. Both dr.

I do think I found my new primary doctor though! ",
